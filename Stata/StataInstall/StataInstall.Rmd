# Stata Installation

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **Your professional conduct is greatly appreciated. Out of respect to your fellow workshop attendees and instructors, please arrive at your workshop on time, having pre-installed all necessary software and materials. This will likely take 10-15 minutes.**
</div>


## Troubleshooting

Unfortunately, we are not able to help with any Stata download or installation problems you may encounter. **If you are unable to download or install Stata SE or MP, please contact your vendor (e.g., HUIT or Stata Corp.) prior to the start of the workshop.** Once the workshop starts we will **NOT** be able to give you one-to-one assistance with setting up Stata. Likewise, if you arrive late, please do **NOT** expect one-to-one assistance for anything covered at the beginning of the workshop.

* [Windows OS](http://kb.winzip.com/kb/entry/26/)


## Software

It is important that you have the **latest numeric version** of Stata installed, which currently is:

* Stata version **16.1**

It does not matter whether you use Stata version MP, SE, or IC in this workshop, since we will not be performing computational intensive analyses. 

**If you are affiliated with Harvard FAS:**

You have access to the licensed Stata MP program. Go to the software download page: https://downloads.fas.harvard.edu/download, log in using your Harvard key and download Stata MP. 

**If you are affiliated with other Harvard schools or MIT:**

* First check with your school or department whether they provide you free access to Stata MP, SE, or IC. 
* If not, you can download the program directly from Stata Corporation with a single user annual license fee starting at $94 for Stata/IC for students or $125 for Stata/IC for education. Stata Corp.'s website is https://www.stata.com/. 


<div class="alert alert-success">
After you successfully installed Stata, you should be able to open the program and see the following start page (note that the Stata version reported may be newer):
