# Stata Installation

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **Your professional conduct is greatly appreciated. Out of respect to your fellow workshop attendees and instructors, please arrive at your workshop on time, having pre-installed all necessary software and materials. This will likely take 10-15 minutes.**
</div>


## Troubleshooting

Unfortunately, we are not able to help with any Stata download or installation problems you may encounter. **If you are unable to download or install Stata SE or MP, please contact your vendor (e.g., HUIT or Stata Corp.) prior to the start of the workshop.**
Once the workshop starts we will **NOT** be able to give you one-to-one assistance with setting up Stata. Likewise, if you arrive late, please do **NOT** expect one-to-one assistance for anything covered at the beginning of the workshop.


## Software

**If you are from Harvard FAS:**

You have access to the licensed Stata MP program. Go to the software download page: https://downloads.fas.harvard.edu/download, log in your Harvard key, and download Stata MP from there. 

**If you are from MIT or other Harvard schools:**

* You want to first check with your school or department whether they provide you free access to Stata SE or Stata MP. 
* If not, you can download the program from Stata Corporation with an annual license fee of close to $300. Their website is https://www.stata.com/ 
* Stata version MP is faster than SE when working with large datasets. However, in this workshop, it doesn't matter which version you use, since we will not be performing computational intensive jobs. 

<div class="alert alert-success">
After you successfully installed Stata, you should be able to open the program with the following start page:
