## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown [@allaire2016rmarkdown] document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

## Including Plots and Tables

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Simple tables can be created using `kable`.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, ], caption = "A knitr kable.")
```

More complex tables can be created using contributed packages such as `tables` or `huxtable`.
