# Python Installation

## Software

You must install the Anaconda Python 3 distribution for these workshops. It is essential that you have Anaconda pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time. The Anaconda Python distribution is designed with data Science
in mind and contains a curated set of 270+ pre-installed packages.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Windows:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Linux:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .sh file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.


Success? After installing, please start the `Anaconda Navigator` program. If you were successful with the installation, you should see a window similar to this:

To check that the installation is working correctly, click the `Launch` button under `Jupyter Notebook`. A new blank notebook should be created.

If you are having any difficulties with the installation, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.
