# Python Installation

## Software

You must install the Anaconda Python 3 distribution for these workshops. It is essential that you have these Anaconda pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Windows:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Linux:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .sh file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.


Success? After installing, please start the `Anaconda Navigator` program. If you were successful with the installation, you should see a window similar to this:

To check that the installation is working correctly, click the `Launch` button under `Jupyter Notebook`. A new blank notebook should be created.

If you are having any difficulties with the installation, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.

## Python interfaces

### Text editors, IDEs, & Notebooks

There are different ways of interfacing with Python. The two main ways are through:

1.  **text editors** or **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Text editors and IDEs are not really separate categories; as you add features to a text editor it becomes more like an IDE. Some editors/IDEs are language-specific while others are general purpose --- typically providing language support via plugins. Here are a few popular editors/IDEs that can be used with Python:

| Editor / IDE | Features  | Ease of use | Language support |
|:------------ |:--------- |:----------- |:---------------- |
| Spyder       | Excellent | Easy        | Python only      |
| PyCharm      | Excellent | Moderate    | Python only      |
| Jupyter Lab  | Good      | Easy        | Excellent        |
| VS code      | Excellent | Easy        | Very good        |
| Atom         | Good      | Moderate    | Good             |
| Vim          | Excellent | Hard        | Good             |
| Emacs        | Excellent | Hard        | Excellent        |

2. **Notebooks:** Web-based applications that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. For these workshops, we will use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/); an open source notebook that has support for 40+ languages. 


### Source code & literate programming

There are also several different **formats** available for writing code in Python. 
These basically boil down to a choice between:

1. **Source code:** the practice of writing code, and possibly comments, in a plain text document. In Python this is done by writing code in a text file with a `.py` extension. Writing source code has the great advantage of being simple. Souce code is the format of choice if you intend to run your code as a complete script - for example, from the command line.

2.  **Literate programming:** the practice of embedding computer code in a natural language document. In Python this is often done using the aformentioned [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a is a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using *Markdown*), mathematics, plots, and rich media, usually ending with the `.ipynb` extension. Jupyter Notebooks are easy to write, human-readable, and the format of choice if you intend to run your code interactively, by running small pieces of code and looking at each output. Researchers can use Notebooks to write their journal papers, dissertations, and statistics/math class notes, since it is easy to convert into other formats later, such as HTML (for a webpage), MS Word, or PDF (via LaTeX).
