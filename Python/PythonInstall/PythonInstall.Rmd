# Python Installation

### Software

You must install the Anaconda Python 3 distribution for these workshops. It is essential that you have these Anaconda pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Windows:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Linux:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .sh file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.


Success? After installing, please start the `Anaconda Navigator` program. If you were successful with the installation, you should see a window similar to this:

To check that the installation is working correctly, click the `Launch` button under `Jupyter Notebook`. A new blank notebook should be created.

If you are having any difficulties with the installation, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.


### Materials

Download class materials for your workshop:

* Python Introduction: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/Python/PythonIntro.zip>
* Python Webscraping: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/Python/PythonWebScrape.zip>

Extract materials from the zipped directory (Right-click => Extract All on Windows, double-click on Mac) and move them to your desktop!


### Python interfaces

A number of interfaces designed to make it easy to interact with Python are available. The Anaconda distribution that we installed earlier includes both a web-based `Jupyter Notebook` and a more conventional Integrated Development Environment called `Spyder`. For this workshop I encourage you to use `Jupyter Notebook`. In real life you should experiment and choose the interface that you find most comfortable.
