# Python Installation

## Software

Before starting any of our Python workshops, it is necessary to complete 2 tasks. Please make sure both of these tasks are completed **before** you attend your workshop, as, depending on your internet speed, they may take a long time. If you are unable to complete both tasks, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the workshop.

1. download and install **Anaconda Python 3 distribution**
2. download and unzip **class materials**

The Anaconda Python distribution is designed with data Science in mind and contains a curated set of 270+ pre-installed Python packages.


**Mac OS X:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Windows:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.

**Linux:** 

* Install Anaconda Python 3 by downloading and running [this .sh file](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh). Accept the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer.


Success? After installing, please start the `Anaconda Navigator` program. If you were successful with the installation, you should see a window similar to this:

To check that the installation is working correctly, click the `Launch` button under `Jupyter Notebook`. A new blank notebook should be created.

If you are having any difficulties with the installation, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.
