    "There are different ways of interacting with Python. The two main ways are through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **text editors** or **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Text editors and IDEs are not really separate categories; as you add features to a text editor it becomes more like an IDE. Some editors/IDEs are language-specific while others are general purpose --- typically providing language support via plugins. The following table lists a few popular editors/IDEs that can be used with Python. In this workshop, we will use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), a modern \"extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing\" that runs in your web browser.\n",

    "| Spyder       | Excellent | Easy        | Python only      |\n",
    "| PyCharm      | Excellent | Moderate    | Python only      |\n",
    "| Jupyter Lab  | Good      | Easy        | Excellent        |\n",
    "| VS code      | Excellent | Easy        | Very good        |\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Notebooks:** Web-based applications that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. One popular choice is [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/); an open source notebook that has support for 40+ languages, but has limited features compared with the JupyterLab IDE. "

    "There are also several different **formats** available for writing code in Python. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Source code:** the practice of writing code, and possibly comments, in a plain text document. In Python this is done by writing code in a text file with a `.py` extension. Writing source code has the great advantage of being simple. Souce code is the format of choice if you intend to run your code as a complete script - for example, from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Literate programming:** the practice of embedding computer code in a natural language document. In Python this is often done using the aformentioned [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using *Markdown*), mathematics, plots, and rich media, usually ending with the `.ipynb` extension. Jupyter Notebooks are easy to write, human-readable, and the format of choice if you intend to run your code interactively, by running small pieces of code and looking at each output. Researchers can use Notebooks to write their journal papers, dissertations, and statistics/math class notes, since it is easy to convert into other formats later, such as HTML (for a webpage), MS Word, or PDF (via LaTeX). \n",
