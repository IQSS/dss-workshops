    "* practice reading files and manipulating data in python.\n",

The Anaconda distribution that we installed earlier includes both a web-based *Jupyter Notebook* and a more conventional Integrated Development Environment called *Spyder*. For this workshop I encourage you to use *Jupyter Notebook*. In real life you should experiment and choose the interface that you find most comfortable.\n",

For example, we may want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the number of paragraphs in each chapter. Python has a handful of math functions built-in (e.g., `min` and `max`) but built-in math support is pretty limited.\n",
