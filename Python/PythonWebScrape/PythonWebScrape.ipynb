    "from a web service designed for human interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is web scraping legal? Is it ethical?\n",
    "\n",

    "## How does the web work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers connected to the web are called **clients** and **servers**. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Python/PythonWebScrape/images/client_server.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).\n",
    "* **Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.\n",
    "* Your internet connection allows you to send and receive data on the web.\n",
    "* **TCP/IP** are the communication protocols that define how data should travel across the web.\n",
    "* **Domain Name Servers (DNS)** are like an address book for websites. \n",
    "* **HTTP** is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What Happens, Exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a web address into your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on.\n",
    "2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.\n",
    "3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a \"200 OK\" message, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called *data packets*.\n",
    "4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you."
