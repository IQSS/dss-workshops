* Finding help
* Importing packages
* Basic data manipulation
* Operations within groups of data
* Saving data


## Setup

### Class Structure

* Informal --- Ask questions at any time. Really!
* Collaboration is encouraged - please spend a minute introducing yourself to your neighbors!

### Prerequisites

This is an introductory R course:

* Assumes no prior knowledge of **how to use** R
* We do assume you know **why** you want to learn R. If you don't, and want a comparison of R to other statistical software, see our [Data Science Tools](./DataScienceTools.html) workshop
* Relatively slow-paced

### Goals

<div class="alert alert-success">
We will learn about the R language by analyzing a dataset of baby names.
In particular, our goals are to learn about:

1. What R is and how it works
2. How we can interact with R
3. Foundations of the language (functions, objects, assignment)
4. The `tidyverse` package ecosystem for data science
5. Basic data manipulation useful for cleaning datasets
7. Working with grouped data
8. Aggregating data to create summaries
9. Saving objects, data, and scripts

This workshop will not cover how to iterate over collections of data, create
your own functions, produce publication quality graphics, or fit models to data.
These topics are covered in our [R Data Wrangling](./RDataWrangling.html),
[R Graphics](./Rgraphics.html), and [R Regression Models](./Rmodels.html) workshops.

### What is R?

* R is a free language and environment for statistical computing and graphics 
* R is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, meaning that all commands 
  typed on the keyboard are directly executed without requiring to build a complete 
  program (this is like Python and unlike C, Fortran, Pascal, etc.)
* R has existed for over 25 years
* R is modular --- most functionality is from add-on packages. So the language can
  be thought of as a *platform* for creating and running a large number of useful packages.


### Why use R?

* The most popular software for data analysis
* Extremely flexible: can be used to manipulate, analyze, and visualize 
  any kind of data
* Cutting edge statistical tools
* Publication quality graphics
* 15,000+ add on packages covering all aspects of statistics and machine learning
* Active community of users


### How does R work?

While graphical-based statistical software (e.g., SPSS, GraphPad) immediately display
the results of an analysis, **R stores results in an `object` (a data structure)**,
so that an analysis can be done with no result displayed. Such a feature is very
useful, since a user can extract only that part of the results that is of interest
and can pass results into further analyses.

For example, if you run a series of 20 regressions and want to compare the
different regression coefficients, R can display only the estimated coefficients:
thus the results may take a single line, whereas graphical-based software could
open 20 results windows. In addition, these regression coefficients can be passed
directly into further analyses --- such as generating predictions.

![](R/Rintro/images/R_chain.png)

When R is running, variables, data, functions, results, etc., are **stored in memory**
on the computer in the form of `objects` that have a name. The user can
**perform actions** on these objects with `operators` (arithmetic, logical,
comparison, etc.) and `functions` (which are themselves objects). Here's a
schematic of how this all fits together:

![](R/Rintro/images/R_works.png)


### Interfaces

#### Text editors, IDEs, & Notebooks

There are different ways of interacting with R. The two main ways are through:

1. **text editors** or **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Text editors and IDEs are not really separate categories; as you add features to a text editor it becomes more like an IDE. Some editors/IDEs are language-specific while others are general purpose --- typically providing language support via plugins. For these workshops we will use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/); it is a good R-specific IDE with many useful features. Here are a few popular editors/IDEs that can be used with R:

    | Editor / IDE | Features  | Ease of use | Language support |
    |:------------ |:--------- |:----------- |:---------------- |
    | RStudio      | Excellent | Easy        | R only           |
    | Jupyter Lab  | Good      | Easy        | Excellent        |
    | VS code      | Excellent | Easy        | Very good        |
    | Atom         | Good      | Moderate    | Good             |
    | Vim          | Excellent | Hard        | Good             |
    | Emacs        | Excellent | Hard        | Excellent        |

2. **Notebooks:** Web-based applications that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. A popular notebook is the open source [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that has support for 40+ languages. 

#### Source code & literate programming

There are also several different **formats** available for writing code in R. 
These basically boil down to a choice between:

1. **Source code:** the practice of writing code, and possibly comments, in a plain text document. In R this is done by writing code in a text file with a `.R` or `.r` extension. Writing source code has the great advantage of being simple. Souce code is the format of choice if you intend to run your code as a complete script - for example, from the command line.

2.  **Literate programming:** the practice of embedding computer code in a natural language document. In R this is often done using [**Rmarkdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which involves embeddeding R code in a document that is authored using *Markdown* and which has a `.Rmd` extension. *Markdown* is easy to write and designed to be human-readable. Markdown is the format of choice if you intend to run your code interactively, by running small pieces of code and looking at each output. Many researchers use Markdown to write their journal papers, dissertations, and statistics/math class notes, since it is easy to convert into other formats later, such as HTML (for a webpage), MS Word, or PDF (via LaTeX). 

Here are some resources for learning more about Rmarkdown and RStudio: 

* <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html>
* <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/vignettes/rmarkdown.html>
* <https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf>


### Launch a session

Start RStudio and create a new project:

* On Windows click the start button and search for RStudio. On Mac
  RStudio will be in your applications folder.
* In Rstudio go to `File -> New Project`.
* Choose `Existing Directory` and browse to the workshop materials directory on your desktop.
* Choose `File -> Open File` and select the file with the word "BLANK" in the name.


### Exercise 0

The purpose of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to explore
the interface provided by RStudio. You may not know how to do these things; 
that's fine! This is an opportunity to figure it out.

Also keep in mind that we are living in a golden age of tab completion.
If you don't know the name of an R function, try guessing the first two
or three letters and pressing TAB. If you guessed correctly the function
you are looking for should appear in a pop up!


 1. Try to get R to add 2 plus 2.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Try to calculate the square root of 10.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. R includes extensive documentation, including a manual named "An
    introduction to R". Use the RStudio help pane to locate this manual.

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:red"><b>Click for Exercise 0 Solution</b></span></summary>
  <div class="alert alert-danger">

1. 2 plus 2

    ```{r}
    2 + 2
    # or
    sum(2, 2)
    ```

2. square root of 10

    ```{r}
    sqrt(10)
    # or
    10^(1/2)
    ```

3. Find "An Introduction to R".

    ```{r}
    # Go to the main help page by running 'help.start() or using the GUI
    # menu, find and click on the link to "An Introduction to R".
    ```
</div>
</details>

### Syntax rules

* R is case sensitive
* R ignores white space
* Variable names should start with a letter (A-Z and a-z) 
  and can include letters, digits (0-9), dots (.), and underscores (_)
* Comments can be inserted using a hash `#` symbol
* Functions must be written with parentheses, even
  if there is nothing within them; for example: `ls()`


### Function calls

**Functions perform actions** --- they take some input, called `arguments` and return some
output (i.e., a result). Here's a schematic of how a function works:

![](R/Rintro/images/function.png)

The general form for calling R functions is

```{r}
## FunctionName(arg.1 = value.1, arg.2 = value.2, ..., arg.n = value.n)
```

The arguments in a function can be objects (data, formulae, expressions, etc.), 
some of which could be defined by default in the function; these default values may
be modified by the user by specifying options.

Arguments can be **matched by name**; unnamed arguments will be **matched by position**.

```{r}
round(x = 2.34, digits = 1) # match by name
round(2.34, 1) # match by position
round(1, 2.34) # be careful when matching by position!
round(digits = 1, x = 2.34) # matching by name is safer!
```

### Assignment

Objects (data structures) can be assigned names and used in subsequent operations:

* The **gets** `<-` operator (less than followed by a dash) is used to save objects
* The name on the left **gets** the object on the right 

```{r}
sqrt(10) ## calculate square root of 10; result is not stored anywhere
x <- sqrt(10) # assign result to a variable named x
```

Names should start with a letter, and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and periods.


### Asking for help

1. You can ask R for help using the `help` function, or the `?` shortcut.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    help(help)
    ?help
    ?sqrt
    ```

    The `help` function can be used to look up the documentation for a function, or
    to look up the documentation to a package. We can learn how to use the `stats`
    package by reading its documentation like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    help(package = "stats")
    ```

2. If you know the name of the package you want to use, then Googling "R *package-name*" will
often get you to the documentation. Packages are hosted on several different repositories, including:

    * CRAN: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html> 
    * Bioconductor: <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/>
    * Github: <http://rpkg.gepuro.net/>
    * R-Forge: <https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1326>

3. If you know the type of analysis you want to perform, you can Google "CRAN Task Views", 
where there are curated lists of packages <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/>. If you want to
know which packages are popular, you can look at <https://r-pkg.org>.


### Reading data

R has data reading functionality built-in -- see e.g.,
`help(read.table)`. However, faster and more robust tools are
available, and so to make things easier on ourselves we will use a
*contributed package* instead. This requires that we
learn a little bit about packages in R.


### Installing & using packages

R is a modular environment that is extended by the use of **packages**.
Packages are collections of functions or commands that are designed to
perform specific tasks (e.g., fit a type of regression model). A large 
number of contributed packages are available (> 15,000). 

Using an R package is a **two step process**:

 1. Install the package onto your computer using the
    `install.packages()` function. This only needs to
    be done the **first time** you use the package.

 2. Load the package into your R session's search path 
    using the `library()` function. This needs to be done
    **each time** you use the package.


### The `tidyverse`

While R's built-in packages are powerful, in recent years there has
been a big surge in well-designed *contributed packages* for R. In 
particular, a collection of R packages called 
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) have been 
designed specifically for data science. All packages included in 
`tidyverse` share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and 
data structures. This philosopy is rooted in the idea of "tidy data":

![](R/Rintro/images/tidy_data.png)

A typical workflow for using `tidyverse` packages looks like this:

![](R/Rintro/images/tidy_workflow.png)

You should have already installed the `tidyverse` and `rmarkdown`
packages onto your computer before the workshop 
--- see [R Installation](./Rinstall.html). 
Now let's load these packages into the search path of our R session.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
```

### Readers for common file types

To read data from a file, you have to know what kind of file
it is. The table below lists functions from the `readr` package, which
is part of `tidyverse`, that can import data from common plain-text formats.

| Data Type                 | Function        |
|:--------------------------|:----------------|
| comma separated           | `read_csv()`    |
| tab separated             | `read_delim()`  |
| other delimited formats   | `read_table()`  |
| fixed width               | `read_fwf()`    |

**Note** You may be confused by the existence of similar functions,
e.g., `read.csv` and `read.delim`. These are legacy functions that
tend to be slower and less robust than the `readr` functions. One way
to tell them apart is that the faster more robust versions use
underscores in their names (e.g., `read_csv`) while the older
functions use dots (e.g., `read.csv`). My advice is to use the more
robust newer versions, i.e., the ones with underscores.

### Baby names data

As an example project we will analyze the popularity of baby names in the US from 1960 through 2017. The data were retrieved from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data.

Here are the questions we will use R to answer:

1. In which year did your name (or another name) occur most frequently by **count**?
2. Which names have the highest popularity by **proportion** for each sex and year?
3. How does the percentage of babies given one of the top 10 names of the year change over time?


### Exercise 1

**Reading the baby names data** 

Make sure you have installed the `tidyverse` suite of packages and attached them with `library(tidyverse)`. 

 1. Open the `read_csv()` help page to determine how to use it to read in data.
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Read the baby names data using the `read_csv()` function and assign the result 
    with the name `baby_names`.
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. BONUS (optional): Save the `baby_names` data as a Stata data set `babynames.dta` 
    and as an R data set `babynames.rds`.
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}

    write_rds(baby_names, file = “babynames.rds”)
    ```
</div>
</details>

## Manipulating data 

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn about basic data manipulation used to clean datasets.** In particular:

1. Filtering data by choosing rows --- using the `filter()` function
2. Selecting data by choosing columns --- using the `select()` function
3. Arranging data by reordering rows --- using the `arrange()` function
4. Using the pipe `%>%` operator to simplify sequential operations
</div>

In this section we will pull out specific names from the baby names data and 
examine changes in their popularity over time. 

The `baby_names` object we created in the last exercise is a `data.frame`.
There are many other data structures in R, but for now we'll focus on 
working with `data.frames`. Think of a `data.frame` as a spreadsheet. 
If you want to know more about R data structures, you can see a summary
in our [R Data Wrangling](./RDataWrangling.html#data-types-and-structures) workshop.

R has decent data manipulation tools built-in -- see e.g.,
`help(Extract)`. But, `tidyverse` packages often provide
more intuitive syntax for accomplishing the same task. In
particular, we will use the `dplyr` package from `tidyverse`
to filter, select, and arrange data, as well as create new variables.

![](R/Rintro/images/dplyr.png)


### Filter, select, & arrange

One way to find the year in which your name was the most popular
is to filter out just the rows corresponding to your name, and 
then arrange (sort) by Count. 

To demonstrate these techniques we'll try to determine whether 
"Alex"" or "Mark" was more popular in 1992. We start by filtering the
data so that we keep only rows where Year is equal to `1992` and Name is
either "Alex" or "Mark".

```{r}
## Read in the baby names data if you haven't already
baby_names <- read_csv("babyNames.csv")
```

```{r}
baby_names_alexmark <- filter(baby_names, 
             Year == 1992 & (Name == "Alex" | Name == "Mark"))

print(baby_names_alexmark) # explicit printing
baby_names_alexmark # implicit printing
```

Notice that we can combine conditions using `&` (AND) 
and `|` (OR). 

In this case it's pretty easy to see that "Mark" is more popular, 
but to make it even easier we can arrange the data so that the 
most popular name is listed first.

```{r}
arrange(baby_names_alexmark, Count)
```

```{r}
arrange(baby_names_alexmark, desc(Count))
```

We can also use the `select()` function to subset the `data.frame`
by columns. We can then assign the output to a new object. If we 
would just like to glance at the first few lines we can use the
 `head()` function:

```{r}
baby_names_subset <- select(baby_names, Name, Count)

head(baby_names_subset)
head(baby_names_subset, n = 6) # default is n = 6
```

### Logical & relational operators

In a previous example we used `==` to filter rows.
Here's a table of other commonly used relational operators:

 | Operator  | Meaning                   | 
 |:----------|:--------------------------| 
 | `==`      | equal to                  | 
 | `!=`      | not equal to              | 
 | `>`       | greater than              | 
 | `>=`      | greater than or equal to  | 
 | `<`       | less than                 | 
 | `<=`      | less than or equal to     | 
 | `%in%`    | contained in              | 

These relational operators may be combined with logical operators, such as `&` (and) or `|` (or).
For example, we can create a **vector** (a **container for a collection of values**) and demonstrate
some ways to combine operators:

```{r}
x <- 1:10 # a vector
x

x > 7 # a simple condition
x > 7 | x < 3 # two conditions combined
```

If we want to match multiple elements from two vectors we can use the `%in%` operator:

```{r}
# x %in% vector
# elements of x matched in vector
x %in% c(1, 5, 10) 
```

Notice that logical and relational operators return **logical vectors** of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values.
The logical vectors returned by these operators can themselves be operated on by functions:

```{r}
x > 7
sum(x > 7)
```

### Exercise 2.1

**Peak popularity of your name**

In this exercise you will discover the year your name reached its maximum popularity.

Read in the "babyNames.csv" file if you have not already done so,
assigning the result to `baby_names`. Make sure you have installed 
the `tidyverse` suite of packages and attached them with `library(tidyverse)`.

 1. Use `filter` to extract data for your name (or another name of your choice). 
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Arrange the data you produced in step 1 above by `Count`. 
    In which year was the name most popular?
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. BONUS (optional): Filter the data to extract *only* the 
    row containing the most popular boys name in 1999.
    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:red"><b>Click for Exercise 2.1 Solution</b></span></summary>
  <div class="alert alert-danger">

1. Use `filter` to extract data for your name (or another name of your choice).

    ```{r}
    baby_names_george <- filter(baby_names, Name == "George")
    ```

2. Arrange the data you produced in step 1 above by `Count`. In which year was the name most popular?

    ```{r}
    arrange(baby_names_george, desc(Count))
    ```

3. BONUS (optional): Filter the data to extract _only_ the row containing the most popular boys name in 1999.

    ```{r}
    baby_names_boys_1999 <- filter(baby_names,
                                   Year == 1999 & Sex == "Boys")
    ```

    ```{r}
    filter(baby_names_boys_1999, Count == max(Count))
    ```
</div>
</details>


### Pipe operator

There is one very special operator in R called a **pipe** operator that 
looks like this: `%>%`. It allows us to "chain" several function calls and, 
as each function returns an object, feed it into the next call in a single 
statement, without needing extra variables to store the intermediate 
results. The point of the pipe is to help you write code in a way that is
easier to read and understand as we will see below.

![](R/Rintro/images/magrittr.png)

There is no need to load any additional packages as the operator is made 
available via the `magrittr` package installed as part of `tidyverse`. Let's 
rewrite the sequence of commands to output ordered counts for names 
"Alex" or "Mark".

```{r}
# unpiped version
baby_names_alexmark <- filter(baby_names, Year == 1992 & (Name == "Alex" | Name == "Mark"))
arrange(baby_names_alexmark, desc(Count))
```

```{r}
# piped version
baby_names %>% 
  filter(Year == 1992 & (Name == "Alex" | Name == "Mark")) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))
```

Hint: try pronouncing "then" whenever you see `%>%`. Using pseudocode,
we can see what the pipe is doing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# unpiped version
filter(dataset, condition)

# piped version
dataset %>% filter(condition)

# what the pipe is doing
output_of_thing_on_left %>% becomes_input_of_thing_on_right
```

Advantages of using the pipe:

1. We can avoid creating intermediate variables, such as `baby_names_alexmark`
2. Less to type 
3. Easier to read and follow the logic (especially avoiding using nested functions)


### Exercise 2.2

Rewrite the solution to Exercise 2.1 using pipes. Remember that we were looking
for the year your name reached its maximum popularity. For that, we filtered 
the data and then arranged by `Count`.

```{r}
##
```

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:red"><b>Click for Exercise 2.2 Solution</b></span></summary>

```
</div>

## Plotting data

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: Plot baby name trends over time -- using the `qplot()` function**
</div>

It can be difficult to spot trends when looking at summary tables.
Plotting the data makes it easier to identify interesting patterns.

R has decent plotting tools built-in -- see e.g., `help(plot)`.
However, again, we will make use of a *contributed
package* from `tidyverse` called `ggplot2`.

For quick and simple plots we can use the `qplot()` function from `ggplot2`. For example,
we can plot the number of babies given the name "Diana" over time like this:

```{r}
baby_names_diana <- filter(baby_names, Name == "Diana")
```

```{r}
qplot(x = Year, y = Count,
     data = baby_names_diana)
```

Interestingly, there are usually some gender-atypical names, even for very strongly 
gendered names like "Diana". Splitting these trends out by `Sex` is very easy:

```{r}
qplot(x = Year, y = Count, color = Sex,
      data = baby_names_diana)
```


### Exercise 3 

**Plot peak popularity of your name**

 1. Use `filter` to extract data for your name (same as previous exercise)

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Plot the data you produced in step 1 above, with `Year` on the x-axis
    and `Count` on the y-axis.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. Adjust the plot so that is shows boys and girls in different colors.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 4. BONUS (Optional): Adjust the plot to use lines instead of points.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

## Creating variables

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn how to create new variables with and without grouped data.** In particular:

1. Creating new variables (columns) --- using the `mutate()` function
2. Creating new variables within groups --- by combining the `mutate()` and `group_by()` functions
3. Recode existing variables --- by combining the `mutate()` and `case_when()` functions
</div>

We want to use these skills to find out which names have been the most popular.

### Create or modify columns

So far we've used `Count` as a measure of popularity. A better
approach is to use proportion to avoid confounding 
popularity with the number of babies born in a given year. 

The `mutate()` function makes it easy to add or modify the columns 
of a `data.frame`. For example, we can use it to rescale the count
of each name in each year:

```{r}
baby_names <- baby_names %>% mutate(Count_1k = Count/1000)
head(baby_names) 
```

### Operating by group

Because of the nested nature of our data, we want to compute proportion 
or rank **within** each `Sex` by `Year` group. The `dplyr` 
package has a `group_by()` function that makes this relatively 
straightforward. Here's the logic behind this process:

![](R/Rintro/images/mutate_group_by.png)

Note that the `group_by()` function converts a **data frame** into a
**grouped data frame** --- that is, a data frame with metadata identifying
the groups. The data remain grouped until you change the groups by
running `group_by()` again or remove the grouping metadata using
`ungroup()`.

Here's the code that implements the calculation:

```{r}
baby_names <-
  baby_names %>%
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  mutate(Rank = rank(Count_1k)) %>%
  ungroup()

head(baby_names)
```

### Recoding variables

It's often necessary to create a new variable that is a recoded version of an existing variable.
For example, we might want to take our `Count_1k` variable and create a new variable that divides
it into `low`, `medium`, and `high` categories. To do this, we can use the `case_when()`
function within the `mutate()` function:

```{r}
baby_names <-
  baby_names %>%
  mutate(Count_levels = case_when(
                            Count_1k <= 10                  ~ "low",
                            Count_1k  > 10 & Count_1k <= 40 ~ "medium",
                            Count_1k  > 40                  ~ "high"
                            ))

head(baby_names)                            
```

### Exercise 4

**Most popular names**

In this exercise your goal is to identify the most popular names for each year.

 1. Use `mutate()` and `group_by()` to create a column named `Proportion`
    where `Proportion = Count/sum(Count)` for each `Year X Sex` group.
    Use pipes wherever it makes sense.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Use `mutate()` and `group_by()` to create a column named `Rank` where 
    `Rank = rank(desc(Count))` for each `Year X Sex` group. 

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. Filter the baby names data to display only the most popular name 
    for each `Year X Sex` group. Keep only the columns: `Year`, `Name`, 
    `Sex`, and `Proportion`.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 4. Plot the data produced in step 3, putting `Year` on the x-axis
    and `Proportion` on the y-axis. How has the proportion of babies
    given the most popular name changed over time?

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 5. BONUS (optional): Which names are the most popular for both boys and girls?

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

      group_by(Year, Sex) %>%

      group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
      mutate(Rank = rank(desc(Count))) %>%
      ungroup()

    head(baby_names)
    ```

3. Filter the baby names data to display only the most popular name for each `Year X Sex` group.

    ```{r}
    top1 <- 
      baby_names %>%
      filter(Rank == 1) %>%
      select(Year, Name, Sex, Proportion)

    head(top1)
    ```

4. Plot the data produced in step 3, putting `Year` on the x-axis and `Proportion` on the y-axis. How has the proportion of babies given the most popular name changed over time?

          y = Proportion, 
          color = Sex, 
          data = top1, 
          geom = "line")
    ```

5. BONUS (optional): Which names are the most popular for both boys and girls?

    ```{r}
    girls_and_boys <- inner_join(filter(baby_names, Sex == "Boys"), 
                                filter(baby_names, Sex == "Girls"),
                                by = c("Year", "Name"))

    girls_and_boys <- mutate(girls_and_boys,
                            Product = Count.x * Count.y,
                            Rank = rank(desc(Product)))

    filter(girls_and_boys, Rank == 1)
    ```
</div>
</details>


## Aggregating variables

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn how to aggregate data to create summaries with and without grouped data.** In particular:

1. Collapsing data into summaries --- using the `summarize()` function 
2. Creating summaries within groups --- by combining the `summarize()` and `group_by()` functions 
</div>

You may have noticed that the percentage of babies given the most 
popular name of the year appears to have decreased over time. We can
compute a more robust measure of the popularity of the most popular
names by calculating the number of babies given one of the top 10 girl
or boy names of the year.

To compute this measure we need to operate within groups, as
we did using `mutate()` above, but this time we need to collapse each
group into a single summary statistic. We can achieve this using the
`summarize()` function. 

First, let's see how this function works without grouping. The following 
code outputs the total number of girls and boys in the data:

```{r}
baby_names %>% 
  summarize(Girls_n = sum(Sex=="Girls"),
            Boys_n = sum(Sex=="Boys"))
```

Next, using `group_by()` and `summarize()` together, we can calculate the 
number of babies born each year. Here's the logic behind this process:

![](R/Rintro/images/summarize_group_by.png)

Note that, unlike with the `mutate()` function, the `summarize()` function returns a data frame
with fewer rows than the original, because of aggregation.

Here's the code that implements the calculation:

```{r}
bn_by_year <-
  baby_names %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Total = sum(Count)) %>%
  ungroup()

head(bn_by_year)
```


### Exercise 5

**Popularity of the most popular names**

In this exercise we will plot trends in the proportion of boys and girls 
given one of the 10 most popular names each year.

 1. Filter the `baby_names` data, retaining only the 10 most popular girl
    and boy names for each year.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 2. Summarize the data produced in step one to calculate the total
    Proportion of boys and girls given one of the top 10 names
    each year.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

 3. Plot the data produced in step 2, with year on the x-axis
    and total proportion on the y axis. Color by `Sex` and notice
    the trend.

    ```{r}
    ##
    ```

  <div class="alert alert-danger">

1. Filter the baby_names data, retaining only the 10 most popular girl and boy names for each year.

      most_popular %>% # it is already grouped by Year and Sex
      summarize(TotalProportion = sum(Proportion))

          y = TotalProportion, 
          color = Sex,
          data = top10,
          geom = "line")

## Saving work

<div class="alert alert-info">
**GOAL: To learn how to save objects, data, and scripts for later use.**
</div>

Now that we have made some changes to our data set, we might want to
save those changes to a file.

### Saving individual datasets

You might find functions `write_csv()` and `write_rds()` from package 
`readr` handy!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write data to a .csv file
write_csv(baby_names, "babyNames.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write data to an R file
write_rds(baby_names, "babyNames.rds")
```

### Saving multiple datasets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls() # list objects in our workspace
save(baby_names_diana, bn_by_year, baby_names_subset, file="myDataFiles.RData")  
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Load the "myDataFiles.RData"
## load("myDataFiles.RData") 
```

### Saving & loading workspaces

In addition to importing individual datasets, R can save and load entire
"workspaces". The workspace is your current R working environment and includes
any user-defined objects. At the end of a session, you can save an "image"
of the current workspace, which allows you to automatically reload the objects
you previously created.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls() # list objects in our workspace
save.image(file="myWorkspace.RData") # save workspace 
rm(list=ls()) # remove all objects from our workspace 
ls() # list stored objects to make sure they are deleted
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Load the "myWorkspace.RData" file and check that it is restored
load("myWorkspace.RData") # load myWorkspace.RData
ls() # list objects
```
