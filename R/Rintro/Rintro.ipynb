    "\n",
    "#### Text editors, IDEs, & Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of interacting with R. The two main ways are through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **text editors** or **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Text editors and IDEs are not really separate categories; as you add features to a text editor it becomes more like an IDE. Some editors/IDEs are language-specific while others are general purpose --- typically providing language support via plugins. For these workshops we will use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/); it is a good R-specific IDE with many useful features. Here are a few popular editors/IDEs that can be used with R:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Editor / IDE | Features  | Ease of use | Language support |\n",
    "|:------------ |:--------- |:----------- |:---------------- |\n",
    "| RStudio      | Excellent | Easy        | R only           |\n",
    "| Jupyter Lab  | Good      | Easy        | Excellent        |\n",
    "| VS code      | Excellent | Easy        | Very good        |\n",
    "| Atom         | Good      | Moderate    | Good             |\n",
    "| Vim          | Excellent | Hard        | Good             |\n",
    "| Emacs        | Excellent | Hard        | Excellent        |\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Notebooks:** Web-based applications that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. A popular notebook is the open source [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that has support for 40+ languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Source code & literate programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several different **formats** available for writing code in R. \n",
    "These basically boil down to a choice between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source code:** the practice of writing code, and possibly comments, in a plain text document. In R this is done by writing code in a text file with a `.R` or `.r` extension. Writing source code has the great advantage of being simple. Souce code is the format of choice if you intend to run your code as a complete script - for example, from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Literate programming:** the practice of embedding computer code in a natural language document. In R this is often done using [**Rmarkdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which involves embeddeding R code in a document that is authored using *Markdown* and which has a `.Rmd` extension. *Markdown* is easy to write and designed to be human-readable. Markdown is the format of choice if you intend to run your code interactively, by running small pieces of code and looking at each output. Many researchers use Markdown to write their journal papers, dissertations, and statistics/math class notes, since it is easy to convert into other formats later, such as HTML (for a webpage), MS Word, or PDF (via LaTeX). \n",
