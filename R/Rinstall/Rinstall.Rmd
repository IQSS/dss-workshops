# R Installation

Before starting any of our R workshops, it is necessary to complete 3 tasks:

1. download and install R and RStudio software
2. download and unzip class materials
3. install the `tidyverse` suite of R packages


## Software

You must install **both R and RStudio**; it is essential that you have these pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). 
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE by downloading and running [this .dmg file](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.2.5033.dmg).

**Windows:** 

* Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html).
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.2.5033.exe).

**Linux:** 

* Install R by downloading the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R). 
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE [for your distribution](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Success? After both installations, please launch RStudio. If you were successful with the installations, you should see a window similar to this:

![](R/Rinstall/images/rstudio_successful_install.png)

(Please note that the version of R reported may be newer). If you are having any difficulties with the installations or your RStudio screen does not look like this one, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.


## Materials

Download class materials for your workshop:

* R Introduction: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rintro.zip>
* R Regression Models: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rmodels.zip>
* R Graphics: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rgraphics.zip>
* R Data Wrangling: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/RDataWrangling.zip>

Extract materials from the zipped directory (Right-click -> Extract All on Windows, double-click on Mac) and move them to your desktop!


## Launch an R session

Start RStudio and create a new project:

* On Windows click the start button and search for RStudio. On Mac
    RStudio will be in your applications folder.
* In Rstudio go to `File -> New Project`.
* Choose `Existing Directory` and browse to the workshop materials directory on your desktop.
* Choose `File -> Open File` and select the file with the word "BLANK" in the name.


## Installing R packages

R is a modular environment that is extended by the use of **packages**.
Packages are collections of functions or commands that are designed to
perform specific tasks (e.g., fit a type of regression model). A large 
number of contributed packages are available (> 15,000). 

Using an R package is a **two step process**:

1.  Install the package onto your computer using the
 `install.packages()` function. This only needs to
 be done the **first time** you use the package.

2.  Load the package into your R session's search path 
 using the `library()` function. This needs to be done
 **each time** you use the package.


## `tidyverse` for data science

While R's built-in packages are powerful, in recent years there has
been a big surge in well-designed *contributed packages* for R. In 
particular, a collection of R packages called 
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) have been 
designed specifically for data science. All packages included in 
`tidyverse` share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and 
data structures. This philosopy is rooted in the idea of "tidy data":

A typical workflow for using `tidyverse` packages looks like this:

## Installing the `tidyverse`

We will use the `tidyverse` suite of packages throughout these R workshops, 
so let's install them now by entering the command:

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

at the command prompt in the console (the bottom left panel in RStudio) and press Enter. 
When you install `tidyverse` for the first time you will be asked a question
about installing packages from source - please answer by typing "no" in the console.
A number of messages will then scroll by, and there will be a long minute or two 
pause where nothing appears to happen (but the installation is actually occurring). 
At last, the output parade should end with a message like:

`The downloaded source/binary packages are in....` 

If not, please stop by the training room at least 20 minutes before the start of your workshop.

We will also install the `rmarkdown` package, which will allow us to
combine our text and code into a formatted document at the end of 
the workshops. Please enter the command:

`install.packages("rmarkdown")`

at the command prompt in the console (the bottom left panel in RStudio), 
press Enter, and then wait for the stream of messages to end with:

`The downloaded source/binary packages are in....`

If all the above steps have been completed successfuly, you should now
be ready to start your workshop. If you ran into any problems, please 
stop by the training room at least 20 minutes before the start of your workshop.
