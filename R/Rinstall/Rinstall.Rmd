# R Installation

Before starting any of our R workshops, it is necessary to complete 4 tasks. Please make sure all these tasks are completed **before** you attend your workshop, as, depending on your internet speed, they may take a long time. 

1. download and install **R**
2. download and install **RStudio**
3. download and unzip **class materials**
4. install the `tidyverse` suite of **R packages**

## Troubleshooting session

We will hold a troubleshooting session during the 20 minutes prior to the start of the workshop. 
**If you are unable to complete all of the tasks, please stop by the training room during this session.**
Once the workshop starts we will **NOT** be able to give you one-to-one assistance with troubleshooting installation problems. Likewise, if you arrive late, please do **NOT** expect one-to-one assistance for anything covered at the beginning of the workshop.


## Software

You must install **both R and RStudio**; it is essential that you have these pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time.

**Mac OS X:** 

* Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). 
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE by downloading and running [this .dmg file](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.2.5033.dmg).

**Windows:** 

* Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html).
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.2.5033.exe).

**Linux:** 

* Install R by downloading the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R).
* Install the RStudio Desktop IDE [for your distribution](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Success? After both installations, please launch RStudio. If you were successful with the installations, you should see a window similar to this:

![](R/Rinstall/images/rstudio_successful_install.png)

(Please note that the version of R reported may be newer). **If you are having any difficulties with the installations or your RStudio screen does not look like this one, please stop by the training room 20 minutes prior to the start of the  workshop.**


## Materials

Download class materials for your workshop:

* R Introduction: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rintro.zip>
* R Regression Models: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rmodels.zip>
* R Graphics: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/Rgraphics.zip>
* R Data Wrangling: <https://github.com/IQSS/dss-workshops/raw/master/R/RDataWrangling.zip>

Extract materials from the zipped directory (Right-click -> Extract All on Windows, double-click on Mac) and move them to your desktop!


## Installing the `tidyverse`

We will use the `tidyverse` suite of packages throughout these R workshops. 
Here are the steps involved:

1.  Launch an R session within RStudio

    On Windows, click the start button and search for RStudio. On Mac,
    RStudio will be in your applications folder.


2.  In the left hand window (called the `console`), at the command prompt `>` type the following and press enter:

    `install.packages("tidyverse")`

    **When you install `tidyverse` for the first time you may be asked a question**
    **about installing packages from source - please answer by typing "no" in the console.**
    A number of messages will then scroll by, and there will be a long minute or two
    pause where nothing appears to happen (but the installation is actually occurring).
    At last, the output parade should end with a message like:

    `The downloaded source/binary packages are in....`

3.  We can check that `tidyverse` has installed correctly by connecting it to our R session. 
    Type the following in the console and press enter:

    `library(tidyverse)`

    You should see the following message in the console (note that the version numbers reported may be newer):

    ![](R/Rinstall/images/tidyverse_install.png)

    **If not, please stop by the training room 20 minutes before the start of your workshop.**

4.  We will also install the `rmarkdown` package, which will allow us to
    combine our text and code into a formatted document at the end of
    the workshops. Please enter the command:

    `install.packages("rmarkdown")`

    at the command prompt in the console, press Enter, and then wait for the 
    stream of messages to end with:

    `The downloaded source/binary packages are in....`

5.  We can check that `rmarkdown` has installed correctly by connecting it to our R session. 
    Type the following in the console and press enter:

    `library(rmarkdown)`

    If successful, you should see a command prompt `>` and no messages in the console. 
    **If not, please stop by the training room 20 minutes before the start of your workshop.**

If all the above steps have been completed successfuly, you should now
be ready to start your workshop. **If you ran into any problems, please
stop by the training room 20 minutes before the start of your workshop.**
