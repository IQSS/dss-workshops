Since you'll be writing code you'll want to set up a comfortable environment for writing and editing that code. Which text editors are good for this? You'll probably also want to learn at least one markup language (e.g., LaTeX, Markdown) so that you can create reproducible manuscripts. What tools are good for this? These questions will guide our discussion, the goal of which is to help you decide which tools you should invest time in learning."
